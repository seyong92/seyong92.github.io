### PyTSMod

PyTSMod is a open-source library for Time-Scale Modification algorithms in Python 3. PyTSMod contains basic TSM algorithms such as Overlap-Add (OLA), Waveform-Similarity Overlap-Add (WSOLA), Time-Domain Pitch-Synchronous Overlap-Add (TD-PSOLA), and Phase Vocoder (PV-TSM). We are also planning to add more TSM algorithms and pitch shifting algorithms.
